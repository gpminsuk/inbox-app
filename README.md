This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## AI-Powered Email Actions

The Inbox App uses Google's Gemini AI model to analyze emails and suggest relevant actions. This feature helps users process their emails more efficiently by automatically identifying potential tasks based on email content.

### Setup

To enable the AI-powered action suggestions:

1. Get a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Add your API key to the environment variables:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
   ```
   - For local development: Add to your `.env.local` file
   - For Docker deployment: Add to your environment or set in the `.env` file used by docker-compose

### How It Works

The email processing script:
1. Fetches emails from connected Gmail accounts
2. Analyzes each email's subject and content using Gemini AI
3. Generates 3-5 specific, actionable tasks based on the email
4. Displays these suggested actions alongside the email in the inbox

This integration helps users quickly identify the most relevant actions to take for each email, saving time and improving productivity.
